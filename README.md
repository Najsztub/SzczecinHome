This piece of software is designed to analyse housing market data for Szczecin, Poland scraped using Portia from otodom.pl website. This is a recording of my efforts to learn programming in Python together with some basics of data analysis in software other than commercial Stata, which I seemed to actually like after nearly 3 years of working with it.

We will see how far will this fun-project go. My intentions are to try my best at Machine Learning at some point. We will see...
